Testing notes for chess-nuts

Overview
--------
This project uses Jest and Supertest for API unit testing. The current `tests/api.test.js` runs endpoint-level tests against the Express `app` with internal mocks for the DB, mailer, matchmaking, and game session services. This allows fast, isolated unit tests without a live database or external services.

How the tests are structured
---------------------------
- `tests/api.test.js`:
  - Mocks `utils/db`, `utils/mailer`, `utils/services/matchmakingService`, and `utils/services/gameSessionService` using `jest.mock(...)`.
  - Uses `supertest` to make HTTP requests against the Express app exported by `app.js`.
  - Tests user registration/login flows, matchmaking join/leave, and basic game session creation/moves.

Why mocking is used
-------------------
- Avoids the need for a live MySQL database in unit tests.
- Tests API routes and request/response handling, session behavior, and business logic in isolation.
- Faster and safer for CI pipelines.

Integration tests (recommended next step)
----------------------------------------
If you'd like integration tests that exercise the real database, follow these steps:
1. Add a `test` environment to `knexfile.js` that uses SQLite in-memory. Example:

   test:
     client: 'sqlite3'
     connection: { filename: ':memory:' }
     useNullAsDefault: true

2. Install `sqlite3` as devDependency: `npm install --save-dev sqlite3`.
3. Create a Jest setup file (e.g., `tests/setupTests.js`) that:
   - Sets NODE_ENV=test
   - Initializes Knex with the `test` config
   - Runs migrations (and seeds if needed)
   - Exposes a teardown to destroy the Knex connection after tests
4. In `package.json`, tell Jest to use the setup file via `jest.setupFilesAfterEnv` or `globalSetup`/`globalTeardown` as appropriate.

Tradeoffs:
- Integration tests run slower but verify SQL and schema behavior.
- Keep both unit and integration tests. Use unit tests for fast CI feedback and integration tests for periodic verification.

Suggestions for more tests
-------------------------
- ELO/Evaluation:
  - Unit tests for `utils/services/eloService.js` including expected ELO changes for wins/losses/draws and edge cases (new users, forfeits).
- Game flow:
  - Tests that simulate full game completion (checkmate/draw) and assert ELO updates and session state transitions.
- 2FA:
  - Tests for `POST /api/2fa/verify-2fa` and password change flows.
- Admin endpoints:
  - Tests for paginated user listing and update behavior.
- Error handling:
  - Tests that simulate DB failures by having the DB mock throw errors and ensure the API returns 500 and meaningful messages.

Running tests locally
---------------------
Install deps:
```powershell
npm install
```
Run tests:
```powershell
npm test
```

Notes and caveats
-----------------
- The current mocks are intentionally simple (e.g., storing password as plain text in the mock). If you want to validate bcrypt hashing behavior, modify the mock to hash passwords or compare hashed values.
- The project currently exports `app` from `app.js` so Supertest can require it. The server only starts if `app.js` is run directly.

Next steps I can implement for you
---------------------------------
- Add an in-memory sqlite3 `test` config and Jest setup/teardown for integration tests.
- Add focused unit tests for `eloService.js` (recommended).
- Add CI configuration (GitHub Actions) to run unit tests and optionally integration tests on PRs.

If you want me to proceed, tell me which of the next steps you'd like and I'll implement them.
